## THAT Conference 2019

Day: Wed, Aug 7   Time: 10:30 AM  

Everyone has stress at work. We can't make the stressful events go away, but we may be able to change how we think about them, and how we react to them.
In this session, you will learn about what Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is, and what it can do for you.
We will go over tips and tricks to deal with workplace stressors, big and small. I will share my experiences with workplace trauma and stress to give you some perspective.
You will leave this session with tools to handle your stress at work, helping you to handle situations that may have seemed impossible before.
