# Writing code in the web browser.

A history.
???
So, Coding in the web. It's a thing.
History of web IDEs seems pretty sparse on the web, but things started about ten years ago.
The earliest cloud IDEs I can find references to are eXo Cloud IDE and Cloud9 IDE between 2009-2011.
Language support was rudimentary, performance was subpar, source code managment integration was usually missing, and debugging was very difficult, if not impossible.
Because of the poor developer experience, few developers coded using web IDEs at the start.
But, time passes. Let's skip the middle and fast-forward to now.

# Coding in the browser, with different goals

- Language learning 
- Code Interviews
- Notebooks
- Write and publish
- Collaboration-first 
- Fuller featured IDEs

???

There's a bunch of stuff now in different flavors, although you can tell people are still trying to figure out what people want.
I'm going to divide them into roughly six categories.
- Language learning 
- Code Interviews
- Notebooks
- Write and publish
- Collaboration-first 
- Fuller featured IDEs
---
# Language learning 

???

Stuff made to either learn or test snippets of language.

---
# Code Interviews
???

Coding tools made to record behavior and test knowledge for evaluation
---

# Notebooks
???

Tools made to share data and the work used to reach the results - data science/visualization
---

# Write and publish
???

Tools whose main goal is to streamline the publishing process, often in a "playground" subdomain.
---

# Collaboration-first 
???

Tools that prioritize collaboration and mentoring over everything, potentially including video and audio communication
---

# Fuller featured IDEs

???

Bringing something like a traditional IDE into the web.
