# Finding Your Voice

## Becoming a (tech) speaker

???

Make sure you're in the right room! Which is funny, since there's only one room where talks are happening.

# Learning about yourself - The Lens

![lenses](images/types-of-camera-lenses-featured-800x420.webp)
???

- Who you are helps give you the unique perspective that other people want to hear.
- You and your experiences are the lens that you use to view and present a subject.

Think about 3-5 things that are unique about you.
The combination of seemingly common things might make you unique.
Examples:
- Where, when, and how you grew up
- What you chose to study
- What you spend your time doing (job, hobbies)
- Groups you belong to
- These things are the lens

# What are you proud of?

- Achievements
- Interesting hacks
- Overcoming challenges
- Reinvention

![award](images/award.png# maxw-5)

???

- Think of something that you've done recently that you're proud of.
- Insights about things that make you proud could be useful to others.

# What do you want to learn or to do?

![books](images/stack-of-books.png)

- Learn a language or framework
- Improve a11y on a site or app
- Shoehorn AI into something
- Start a new meetup group

???

Think about what you would like to learn. 
- I can tell you from experience that there is no motivation quite like discussing the topic in front of other people.
- Think about what you would to if you weren't afraid, then do that.
---
# What could you passionately discuss RIGHT NOW?

???

What's on your mind right now that you could talk about for 5 minutes with no preparation?
---
# Find your why.

???

Why do you want to speak?
---
# Have some advice? Be the person you needed when you were younger.

???

What's the advice you needed to hear? Who did you need when you were starting out?  Maybe, you can be that person.
---
# Getting comfortable speaking in front of people

???

You should realize by now that you definitely have insight and information to share.  Now, let's go over some ways to become more at ease with speaking in front of people.

---
# Play a game!

???

One of the ways to get better at speaking is to play games that encourage you to think and synthesize on your feet. There are games that you can play to get better at this.  [Ultraspeaking](https://app.ultraspeaking.com/games/dashboard) has games like this.
---
# Turn on your camera/phone, and speak for 3-5 minutes about anything.

???

One of the best ways to get more comfortable speaking is to record yourself doing it.  One way to do it is to do it and then delete the recording, and the other way is to look at the video and mute the sound.

---
# Find a meetup, and ask to speak!

???

Another way to get more comfortable with speaking is to just go and do it.  Sure, it starts a bit scary, but it gets easier, and you get better!
