Day: Thursday, August 18   

Time: 9:40 AM 

Hear about Impostor Syndrome from a software developer with a Psychology degree.

In this talk, you will learn what Impostor Syndrome is, why it matters in today's workplace, and strategies for conquering it. You will learn ways to be an advocate for others in tech, from people who are just considering a career to long-time industry veterans.

After listening to this talk, you will gain insights about yourself and your co-workers, and you will learn how to be a better person, employee, and advocate for others.

I created a Medium article with some of the resources I collected while researching this session. Feel free to check that out [here](https://medium.com/@rosslarsonWI/resources-for-impostor-syndrome-empathy-and-advoacy-dc40d8c3594e).
