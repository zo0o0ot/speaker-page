 # What is Mindfulness?
![brain](images/brain-borders.png)

- Present Moment Awareness
- Non-Judgmental Acceptance
- Focus
- Observation
- Self-Regulation

???

Present Moment Awareness: 
- Being fully engaged in what you're doing, sensing, and feeling
- Here and now 
- Not letting your mind wander.

Non-Judgmental Acceptance: 
- Observe your experiences without labeling them as good or bad, right or wrong.
- This allows for a sense of calm 
- Helps you avoid getting swept away by negative emotions.

Focus: 
- Bringing attention to a particular object, such as:
- Breath, Bodily Sensations, or the Sounds around you.

Observing Thoughts and Emotions:
- Acknowledge the presence of thoughts and emotions 
- Observe them as they arise and pass, like clouds drifting across the sky.

Self-Regulation: 
- Learning to guide your attention back to the present when your mind inevitably wanders

# What ISN'T Mindfulness?

![brain](images/floating-dude.png)

- One specific method
- A quick fix
- Buddism
- Pro- or Anti-religion
- Emotional suppression
- Floating in the air

???

So, what isn't mindfulness?
- It's not one specific method, like meditiation
- It's not a quick fix that you do once and change your life forever
- Some of the origins of mindfulness are rooted in Buddism, but mindfulness is not specifically or only Buddhist
- You can be religious or non-religious and partice mindfulness. It can coexist with your existing practices.
- You're not just suppressing or escaping your thoughts and emotions. You're still allowed to have thoughts.
- You don't suddenly start floating if you do it right. It may feel awkward the first few times you do it, but it's worth it to keep going.

# The River and  the River's Edge

![waterfall](images/waterfall.jpg)

???

The best way I've found to understand mindfulness is thinking about it this way:

Mindfulness River: 

Flowing Nature:
- The mind is like a river, constantly flowing with thoughts, sensations, and emotions. 

Transient Thoughts:
- Just as the water in a river is always changing, our thoughts and feelings are not permanent and are constantly shifting. 

Acceptance and Non-Judgment:
- A mindfulness practice that uses the "river" metaphor encourages acceptance of this flow without getting caught up in or judging the thoughts. 

Example:
Activities might involve simply observing the "river" of your mind, noticing the thoughts and feelings as they arise and pass away, without trying to control or change them, according to a Facebook group dedicated to mindful practices. 

River's Edge:

Observational Stance:
- This metaphor encourages the practitioner to step back and observe the "river" of their mind from a place of detachment, like standing on the riverbank. 

Non-Identification:
- The "river's edge" helps one recognize that thoughts and feelings are separate from oneself. You are not your thoughts, but rather the observer of your thoughts. 
Inner Peace:
- By observing the thoughts as they pass, practitioners can cultivate a sense of inner peace and reduce identification with negative or overwhelming thoughts. 

Example:
Guided meditations may involve visualizing thoughts as leaves floating on the river, allowing them to pass without engaging with them. 

In essence: The "river" metaphor emphasizes the continuous flow of experience, while the "river's edge" metaphor emphasizes the ability to observe that flow without being swept away by it.
