How do you want to be remembered?

How do you want to be remembered?

It's the question we're trying to get to the bottom of today.

---

Look. 
- Regardless of the effort that we put into it, we don't get to pick how we are remembered. 
- We can remind people how we'd like to be remembered.

# The scope of your digital legacy.

# Let's talk about the scope of our digital legacy.  

- It's either coming from or going to end up on something like these hard drives, memory cards, and flash drives.
- I'm just trying to get you to think about making your digital life a little easier to view, save, and share.

# Why do this now?
## It might not always be this easy.
## In the future, you may have:
- Aphasia or brain stuff
- Vision issues
- Injuries or conditions that affect your ability to type or use a mouse (just ask Clark)
- Other stuff

# The bus factor

???

# Let's talk about the bus factor.
## If a bus hits you and you're not around tomorrow, what are the things that need taking care of?
## As far as I can tell, this stuff falls into three categories:
- Practical stuff
- Digital assets and presence
- Digital media

# Practical stuff
![Pile-of-bills](images/midjourney-a-pile-of-letters-and-bills-on-a-table.png# maxh-6)

- Bill paying
- Bank stuff
- Business stuff
- Access to shared resources

???

The first set of items is "Practical stuff".

- Bill paying
- Bank stuff
- Business stuff
- Access to shared resources

## Anything that helps people continue the day-to-day stuff without you.
- This is the sort of stuff that should be in your will.  
- Write a will. Don't risk the alternative. I hear probate sucks.

# Digital assets with a financial value

## Other than that, I'm not really qualified to talk about this.

## The first big step - Try.NET in the browser

???

- In 2019, .NET started to move foward to the web in a new way.
- A REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) isn't a new concept, but because C# did not start as a web language, it wasn't close to the first language
- Try dot net in the browser was a pretty big step for the .NET stack.
- Apparently, at the start, Microsoft was footing the bill for azure virtual machines that were connecting with every site visitor that wanted to try dotnet in the browser.
- Eventually, Blazor allowed them to save on some server costs.

# `dotnet try` - Creating your own interactive documentation

???

- The website was cool, and it allowed for experimentation, but what about if you wanted to make something interactive for yourself, or someone else?
- The dotnet try tool allows you to match markdown and editable, executable code to be created and served up for yourself or someone else.
- A good example of this is the [hello world](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/hello-world) tutorial on the Micosoft docs site.

# Running `dotnet try` locally

![Dotnet-try-browser](images/dotnet-try.gif)
- Run `dotnet try` from the console 
- (or server)

![Dotnet-try-browser](images/try-markdown.png)
- Markdown mixed with code
- Friendly presentation
- Code is editable by end-user

???

- If you run `dotnet try` locally, it will start a webserver and serve the content into a browser, where you can interact with code blocks and see their results.
- `dotnet try` is pretty cool, but it still requires the user to run the program themselves.
- Also, you run the risk of things running differently on their computer if different packages or versions of things are installed.

![Jupyter](images/jupyter.svg)
# Meanwhile, an (old?) new tool appears from a different land....

???

# Jupyter - a different tool for a different purpose

Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-friendly interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents.

---
class: img-caption
![Jupyter-Dashboard](images/jupyter-dashboard2.png)
# A document-based development model

???

# Jupyter - Document-based development for sharing

A Jupyter Notebook document is a REPL containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media. Underneath the interface, a notebook is a JSON document, following a versioned schema, usually ending with the ".ipynb" extension. 

The project was original brought together to support Julia, Python, and R and help those languages create easily consumable and reproducable content.

You may see some similarities between this and `dotnet-try`.

# Also Emerging: Visual Studio Code
???
# Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code came out in 2015, [and has been evolving rapidly, as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code).
- Their extensions marketplace has allowed for rapid evolution of the editor, and new functionality has been quickly appearing.

# Now........ Let our powers combine!

- ![vs-code](images/vscode.svg# maxw-2) Visual Studio Code
- ![jupyter](images/jupyter.svg# maxw-2) Jupyter Notebooks
- ![dotnet-interactive](images/dotnet-interactive.png# maxw-2) .NET Interactive
- ![OpenSource](images/GitHub-Mark-64px.png# maxw-2) Open Source
- ![heart](images/8bitheart.jpg# maxw-2) Heart

![CaptainPlanet](images/LetOurPowersCombine.gif)

???
# Notebooks are a combination of several powers

- VS Code
- Jupyter
- DotNet Interactive Kernel
- Open Source
- Heart

- Because of the beauty of open source, a rising tide lifts all boats.....
- Microsoft was able to add a .NET Interactive Kernel into Jupyter Notebooks.
- Microsoft then added .NET Notebooks support to VS code via VS Code Extensions
    - First to VS Code (and [nteract](https://nteract.io/), and Azure Data Studio)
    - Then to Visual Studio (as of this month)
- Add some heart, and you have .NET Interactive notebooks!

# So, How am I supposed to use .NET Interactive?

This seems interesting, but how am I supposed to use a tool like .NET Interactive?

Good question!

# You can choose your own adventure!

# The power is yours!

What you can do with a .NET Interactive Notebook is going to be defined by your expertise and interest.

Some possible ideas:

# .NET Interactive Notebooks - Pros and Cons

## Pros
- Integrations for:
    - VS Code, 
    - Visual Studio, 
    - Azure Data Studio
    - and more!
- Broad .NET support + SQL/KML
- Polyglot language support

## Cons
- Still in development - rough edges
- Embedding and sharing interactivity requires a few confusing steps


???
# Pros and Cons
---
class: img-caption
![demo](images/bd-demo.gif)

# Demo Time!

???

# Demos

- Programming model (from Interactive - show batteries included)
- Displaying output (show variable and display commands)
- Formatting output (show messy data display get clean)
- Importing packages (create and import somthing.csx)
- Variable Sharing (sharing across languages)
- Show AIS ships (polyglot, load from file, use all of Norway)
    + AIS: Automatic Identification System
- NFL Draft Notebook (DataFrames and SandDance)
- Mermaid (Show off cool flow charts)
- American Soccer Analysis (If extra time available)

I made my own repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/zo0o0ot/THAT-dotnet-interactive) so that going over these notebooks is less complicated.
You can [open it in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zo0o0ot/THAT-dotnet-interactive/main?urlpath=lab) and most examples work.
