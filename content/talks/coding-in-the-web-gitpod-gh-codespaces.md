## THAT Conference 2021

Day: Tuesday, July 27   Time: 10:30 AM  

Are you working on a side project and aren't close to your development machine? If you have access to a web browser, you can code right now if you develop in the cloud!

As cloud resources and web-based source code management tools improve in quality and affordability over time, the days of needing a dedicated development machine may no longer be necessary for all development workflows.
This is a discussion on developing in the browser, with me showing several examples of projects that I've worked on in Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces.
I will then give some instructions on how to set up your own cloud development environment!

Goals:
At the end of this session, here are some key takeaways:
* Gain a better understanding of cloud-based development in the web browser.
* Know the questions to ask and the steps to take to get started coding in the web.

Useful links:
* [Mind map of this topic](https://coggle.it/diagram/YNfzpcXxkuFt--D4/t/coding-in-a-web-browser!), using [Coggle.it](https://coggle.it/)
* Gitpod created a post [comparing Gitpod to Codespaces](https://www.gitpod.io/gitpod-vs-github-codespaces). It's pretty informative about the general and philosophical differences between the products.
* [Gitpod home page](https://www.gitpod.io/)
* [GitHub Codespaces information page](https://github.com/features/codespaces). It's still in early access, so you would need to [sign up for the beta](https://github.com/features/codespaces/signup) to see anything other than this page.
* [Information on how to configure your Gitpod instance](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure)
* [Information on how to configure Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account)
