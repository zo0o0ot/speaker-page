How do you want to be remembered?

How do you want to be remembered?

It's the question we're trying to get to the bottom of today.

Look. 
- Regardless of the effort that we put into it, we don't get to pick how we are remembered. 
- We can remind people how we'd like to be remembered.

# Maslow's hierarchy of needs
![Maslow's simplified hierarchy of needs](images/Maslow_s_Hierarchy_of_Needs2.svg# maxw-70pct center)

???

# The psychology of legacy
## Legacy is a question of privilege.
- If we look at Abraham Maslow's hierarcy of needs, we have to acknowledge something.
- Prestige and accomplishment are higher level needs.
- We can only really think about them if the lower needs are taken care of.
- Coming out of a pandemic, however, We are in a time of transition.
- We've been collectively worried about security and safety for a while. Let's look further up the pyramid for a change.

# The scope of your digital legacy.
![digital media](images/data-disk-hard-drive-hdd.jpg)

???

# Let's talk about the scope of our digital legacy.  

- It's either coming from or going to end up on something like these hard drives, memory cards, and flash drives.
- Today, I'm trying to get you to think about making your digital life a little easier to view, save, and share.

# Why do this now?

???

# Why do this now?
## It might not always be this easy.
## In the future, you may have:
- Aphasia or brain stuff
- Vision issues
- Injuries or conditions that affect your ability to type or use a mouse (just ask Clark)
- Other stuff

# Disclaimers!

- I'm not a financial consultant
- I'm not a lawyer
- I'm a software developer
- I'm not trying to sell you life insurance
- You should probably have a will, but I'm not qualified to give that advice.

# The bus factor

???

# Let's talk about the bus factor.
## If a bus hits you and you're not around tomorrow, what are the things that need taking care of?
## As far as I can tell, this stuff falls into three categories:
- Practical stuff
- Digital assets and presence
- Digital media

---

class: img-right
# Practical stuff
![Pile-of-bills](images/midjourney-a-pile-of-letters-and-bills-on-a-table.png# maxh-6)

- Bill paying
- Bank stuff
- Business stuff
- Access to shared resources

???

The first set of items is "Practical stuff".

- Bill paying
- Bank stuff
- Business stuff
- Access to shared resources

## Anything that helps people continue the day-to-day stuff without you.
- This is the sort of stuff that should be in your will.  
- Write a will. Don't risk the alternative. I hear probate sucks.

# Digital assets with a financial value
- Cryptocurrency
- Loyalty points
- Travel rewards
- Domain names
- Digital business assets

# Digital assets with a financial value should be in your will.
## Other than that, I'm not really qualified to talk about this.
