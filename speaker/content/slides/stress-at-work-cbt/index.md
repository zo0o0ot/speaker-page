## A note on photos in this presentation.

???

Most stock photos about workplace stress look like this.  It's a person with a hand on their face surrounded by piles of paper.

Looking at stock photos of stressed people is depressing, so I'm making the executive decision to only have this one and to have baby animal pictures for the rest of the presentation.

# Let's talk about stress.

???

Before we get too far, I'd like to talk about stress for a bit.  We're not going to be very good at dealing with stress if we haven't defined what it is.

# The Three Types of Stress

???

There are three types of stress.  Some of them are worse than others.

We're going to start small and get bigger as we go on.

# Health Effects

![Sad Kitten](kitten4.jpg)

- Emotional distress

???
Emotional distress â€” some combination of anger or irritability, anxiety and depression, the three stress emotions.

--
- Muscular problems

???

Muscular problems including tension headache, back pain, jaw pain and the muscular tensions that lead to pulled muscles and tendon and ligament problems.

--
- Stomach, gut, and bowel problems

???

Stomach, gut and bowel problems such as heartburn, acid stomach, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.

--
- Other stuff

???

Transient overarousal leads to elevation in blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, heart palpitations, dizziness, migraine headaches, cold hands or feet, shortness of breath and chest pain.

Acute stress can crop up in anyone's life, and it is highly treatable and manageable.

# Episodic Acute Stress

![Tarsier](tarsier1.jpg)

???

This is like acute stress, but over and over again. It is repeated acute stress, ingrained and habitual.
Two types of folks tend to run into this issue.

---
class: img-caption
# Type A Personalities

![Excited puppy](puppy2.jpg)

???

Type A's have an "excessive competitive drive, aggressiveness, impatience, and a harrying sense of time urgency." In addition there is a "free-floating, but well-rationalized form of hostility, and almost always a deep-seated insecurity." These folks have a higher risk of cardiac issues.

---

# Worry Warts
![Red Lemur](redlemur1.jpg)

???

Another form of episodic acute stress comes from ceaseless worry. "Worry warts" see disaster around every corner and pessimistically forecast catastrophe in every situation. The world is a dangerous, unrewarding, punitive place where something awful is always about to happen. These "awfulizers" also tend to be over aroused and tense, but are more anxious and depressed than angry and hostile.

# Chronic Stress

???

This is serious stuff.  Like, change your brain chemistry permanently kind of stuff.

Chronic stress is grinding stress.  It wears people away day after day, year after year. Chronic stress destroys lives, bodies, and minds. It wreaks havoc through long-term attrition. It is the stress of poverty, dysfunctional families, violence, abuse, trauma, despised job, ethnic rivalry, war.

# Stress at Work

???

Now let's try to focus on stress at work.  Generally stress either comes from work and bleeds into your life or comes from your life and bleeds into your work.

Where does workplace stress come from?
This pie chart from 2006 gives us a clue.

Workloads, people issues, job security, and juggling work and life demands can all contribute.

# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
## [(CBT)](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral)

???

How about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?  It's not the only option, but it can be a good one. Let's learn some more.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment.

Numerous research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning and quality of life. In many studies, CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications.

# CBT Core Principles

![Dog](puppy7.jpg)

- Problems come from faulty or unhelpful ways of thinking

- Problems come from learned patterns of unhelpful behavior

- But, you can learn to do better!

???

- Psychological problems are based, in part, on faulty or unhelpful ways of thinking.

- Psychological problems are based, in part, on learned patterns of unhelpful behavior.

- People suffering from psychological problems can learn better ways of coping with them, thereby relieving their symptoms and becoming more effective in their lives.
