 # What is Mindfulness?
![brain](images/brain-borders.png)

- Present Moment Awareness
- Non-Judgmental Acceptance
- Focus
- Observation
- Self-Regulation

???

Present Moment Awareness: 
- Being fully engaged in what you're doing, sensing, and feeling
- Here and now 
- Not letting your mind wander.

Non-Judgmental Acceptance: 
- Observe your experiences without labeling them as good or bad, right or wrong.
- This allows for a sense of calm 
- Helps you avoid getting swept away by negative emotions.

Focus: 
- Bringing attention to a particular object, such as:
- Breath, Bodily Sensations, or the Sounds around you.

Observing Thoughts and Emotions:
- Acknowledge the presence of thoughts and emotions 
- Observe them as they arise and pass, like clouds drifting across the sky.

Self-Regulation: 
- Learning to guide your attention back to the present when your mind inevitably wanders

# What ISN'T Mindfulness?

![brain](images/floating-dude.png)

- One specific method
- A quick fix
- Buddhism
- Pro- or Anti-religion
- Emotional suppression
- Floating in the air

???

So, what isn't mindfulness?
- It's not one specific method, like meditation
- It's not a quick fix that you do once and change your life forever
- Some of the origins of mindfulness are rooted in Buddhism, but mindfulness is not specifically or only Buddhist
- You can be religious or non-religious and practice mindfulness. It can coexist with your existing practices.
- You're not just suppressing or escaping your thoughts and emotions. You're still allowed to have thoughts.
- You don't suddenly start floating if you do it right. It may feel awkward the first few times you do it, but it's worth it to keep going.

# The River and  the River's Edge

![waterfall](images/waterfall.jpg)

???

The best way I've found to understand mindfulness is thinking about it this way:

Mindfulness River: 

Flowing Nature:
- The mind is like a river, constantly flowing with thoughts, sensations, and emotions. 

Transient Thoughts:
- Just as the water in a river is always changing, our thoughts and feelings are not permanent and are constantly shifting. 

Acceptance and Non-Judgment:
- A mindfulness practice that uses the "river" metaphor encourages acceptance of this flow without getting caught up in or judging the thoughts. 

Example:
Activities might involve simply observing the "river" of your mind, noticing the thoughts and feelings as they arise and pass away, without trying to control or change them, according to a Facebook group dedicated to mindful practices. 

River's Edge:

Observational Stance:
- This metaphor encourages the practitioner to step back and observe the "river" of their mind from a place of detachment, like standing on the riverbank. 

Non-Identification:
- The "river's edge" helps one recognize that thoughts and feelings are separate from oneself. You are not your thoughts, but rather the observer of your thoughts. 
Inner Peace:
- By observing the thoughts as they pass, practitioners can cultivate a sense of inner peace and reduce identification with negative or overwhelming thoughts. 

Example:
Guided meditations may involve visualizing thoughts as leaves floating on the river, allowing them to pass without engaging with them. 

In essence: The "river" metaphor emphasizes the continuous flow of experience, while the "river's edge" metaphor emphasizes the ability to observe that flow without being swept away by it.

# Mindfulness quadrants

Given the number of different ways to express mindfulness, I decided to make a chart to help organize activities based on:
- How informal / formal the activity is
- How much technology is involved.

This is a busy slide, so I'm going to explain each quadrant individually.

# Informal / Low Tech
![informal-low-tech](images/activities-Informal-LowTech.png)

???

Informal / Low Tech - You could do this stuff in the 1800s:
- Walks, journaling, being aware of the world around you

---
class: img-caption
# Informal / High Tech
![informal-high-tech](images/activities-Informal-HighTech.png)

???

Informal / High Tech - Technology is involved but not providing structure:
- Listening to music to be contemplative
- Long-play youtube videos (like a 4 hour train ride in Norway in the snow)
- Playing a game like "Sprit City: Lofi Sessions" that plays lofi music and encourages you to chill or journal

---
class: img-caption
# Formal / Low Tech
![formal-low-tech](images/activities-Formal-LowTech.png)

???

Formal / Low Tech - Structured, but not linked to Tech
- Formal meditation
- Yoga
- Guided exercises like 5-4-3-2-1, RAIN, and Body Scans
 - 5-4-3-2-1 See/Hear/Touch/Smell/Taste

---

Formal / High Tech - Structured, facilitated by technology
- Calm mobile app
- Headspace mobile app
- PLAYNE / INWARD - mediation facilitation video games on Steam 
- VR?

# The RAIN Method

- Recognize
- Allow
- Investigate
- Nurture

???

The Rain method was created by Dr. Tara Branch, PhD.

The acronym RAIN is an easy-to-remember tool for practicing mindfulness and compassion using the following four steps:

- Recognize what is happening;
- Allow the experience to be there, just as it is;
- Investigate with interest and care;
- Nurture with self-compassion.

It's a way to take a frustrating work scenario, allow yourself to process the feelings and situations.

You can do this on your own, or find a guided mindfulness video about it on Youtube. Either way is fine.

Buddhism does not regard the body and the mind or spirit as being two entirely separate entities. The body and mind or spirit combine and interact in a complex way to constitute an individual.

Some Native American cultures have a wholistic model guided by the medicine wheel:
- Mental
- Emotional
- Physical
- Spiritual well-being.

- You now have an overall idea of your wellness
- Maybe, you want to make some changes.
- SMART goals are one way.

1. Specific: Clearly define what you want to achieve. Avoid vague statements. 
2. Measurable: How will you track progress and know when you've achieved the goal? 
3. Achievable: Ensure the goal is realistic and attainable given your resources and circumstances. 
4. Relevant: Ensure the goal aligns with your overall objectives and priorities. 
5. Time-bound: Set a deadline for achieving the goal

# An Alternative: The Half-Year (August) Reset!
- Half mindfulness, Half SMART!
- Clear your mind
- Recognize your previous goals and results
- Assess your successes and failures
- Create an ideal scenario and order your goals
- Envision your success and create systems
- Link to worksheet available on [my site](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qXPd2333U9VPdG5gfOUaq-JdTpJuVfhY/view)!

SMART Goals are great, but with the tools you have, we might be able to go further.
Author, Illustrator, and Youtuber Campbell Walker (AKA struthless) created a workbook that you could use.
- It's half mindfulness exercise, half goal setting.
