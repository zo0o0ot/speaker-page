# Ross Does The Story Remark Themes

[Story](https://github.com/xaprb/story) offers helper themes for creating
beautiful presentations with [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/), using simple
Markdown to create slide layouts.

- Apron defines the layouts' structure and size.
- Adirondack adds typography, theme colors, and helpful features.
- Descartes provides element and image positioning and colors.

Story has a design goal of clean, simple Markdown content. Avoiding "raw" HTML
and Remark's Markdown extensions makes things easier.
View the source of this page to see the Markdown that creates it.

These characteristics make it easy to build gorgeous slideshows. They're also
a great foundation for creating your own themes.
