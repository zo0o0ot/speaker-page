# They’re all impostors.

- (Ping, Monsieur Maire, Prince Ali, Mrs. Doubtfire) Our fiction is full of them.  (Dexter, 21 Jump Street, Pysch, Kindergarten Cop) In fiction, it’s fun to watch an impostor, but it isn’t fun to be one.

# Stigma of Mental Health

???

Way back in 1999 the U.S. Surgeon General labeled stigma as perhaps the biggest barrier to mental health care; this stigma manifests particularly in a phenomenon known as social distancing, whereby people with mental issues are more isolated from others.

But most of them are scared to talk about it. Only 41% of people with a mental disorder get professional help. Help is available, but because we aren’t talking about mental health openly, and we don’t put the time in to educate ourselves about resources, people don’t get what they need. So they stay sick, and suffer unnecessarily.

About 1 in 5 in tech are currently dealing with a mental health issue right now.
