# Finding Your Voice

## Becoming a (tech) speaker

Make sure you're in the right room! Which is funny, since there's only one room where talks are happening.

Hi. I'm Ross. I spoke at my first meetup around 2010, and I've been speaking at a variety of conferences including THAT Conference and DevFestWI. I'm involved with some other stuff, too.

# You can do this.

???

I'm going to start with the main point. You can do this. I'd like to help show you how.
---
# Let's find our voices, together
- Learning about yourself
- Getting comfortable speaking in public
- Submitting talks to conferences
- Getting accepted and preparing to speak

???

Here's the outline of the time we're spending together.
- We are going to do some exercises helping you describe yourself.
- I'm going to over ways to get more comfortable speaking in public.
- I'm going to talk about the process of submitting to conferences
- I'm also going to review the process from getting accepted to being ready to speak.

# Learning about yourself

???

- Who you are helps give you the unique perspective that other people want to hear.
- You and your experiences are the lens that you use to view and present a subject.
---
# What's unique about you?

???

Think about 3-5 things that are unique about you.
The combination of seemingly common things might make you unique.
Examples:
- Where and how you grew up
- What you chose to study
- What you spend your time doing (job, hobbies)

---
# What are you proud of?

???

Think of something that you've done recently that you're proud of.

---
# What do you want to learn?

???

Think about what you would like to learn.
---
# What could you passionately discuss RIGHT NOW?

???

What's on your mind right now that you could talk about for 5 minutes with no preparation?
---
# Find your why.

???

Why do you want to speak?
---
# Be the person you needed when you were younger.

???

What's the advice you needed to hear? Who did you need when you were starting out?  Maybe, you can be that person.
