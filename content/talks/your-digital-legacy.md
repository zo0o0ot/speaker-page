## THAT Conference WI 2023

Day: Tuesday, July 25   

Time: 10:30 AM  

Prepare your digital life for the day that you hope never comes.

This talk exists to help you get your digital life in order, in case the unexpected comes up, and you are no longer able to access technology in general.

There will be a helpful worksheet that you can use to make your own digital legacy plan!

This talk is going to focus on the "life" part of your digital life, so topics are going to be:
- Describing the "Bus Factor", focusing on your personal life.
- Overview of items that need attention
- Practical stuff
- Social media
- Digital files
- Code and repositories
- Digitizing and converting the analog and offline
- Creating conversations and asking good questions to create memories

Goals:
At the end of this session, here are some key takeaways:
* Learn about your digital footprint.
* Tidy up your digital life
* Think about your future
