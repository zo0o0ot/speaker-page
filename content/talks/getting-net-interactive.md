## THAT Conference 2022

Day: Tuesday, July 26   Time: 4:00 PM  

In the past, tools like Jupyter notebooks have allowed folks to create interactive, shareable data experiences using languages like Python and R.  However, with .NET 6, you now have the interactivity and ease of combining markdown and executable code cells to create interesting and novel experiences with your existing .NET skills.

During this session, I will introduce .NET notebooks and show you some of the things that they can do.  I will then show you an example of .NET interactive in action, and provide some suggestions on how you can use .NET Interactive in your projects!

Note: The slides are still a work in progress and should not be considered a final deck at this point.

Goals:
At the end of this session, here are some key takeaways:
* Learn about .NET Interactive Notebooks
* Find ways to use .NET Interactive in your projects
* Learn if .NET Interactive could be useful for you
